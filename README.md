# inzva-applied-ai-homeworks
These homeworks ,about different areas of deep learning and machine learning, are given in Applied AI Program at inzva. 
#### CIFAR-100 -> CNN solution for CIFAR-100 dataset (0.29 accuracy)

#### fraud_detection -> Kaggle Fraud Detection Competition Data Preprocessing and comparision of CATBoost and XGBoost with Bayesian and Random search (0.74 accuracy)

#### crawling_news -> Crawling websites and preprocessing crawled data. Then word2vec implementation of crawled words.

#### char_based_RNN -> Using character based RNN Model for generating sentences with trained model. 

### Template of some notebooks are prepared by applied ai guides. Thanks to all of guides,  and inzva community for the applied ai program.
